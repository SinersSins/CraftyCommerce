Created Repository "CRAFTYCOMMERCE"
cloned it to my local machine
created a .gitignore file


Created 3 separate branches feature-shopping-cart; feature-product-listing; feature-customer-reviews
Used git checkout -b <branchname> command to create and switch into branch.

created separate files of each branch.
added the branch, commit using a message and then pushed to the specific branch


used git log to get detailed log of system and chages
and git status to see current status of branch.

used terminal this time to merge files into the main branch and review the changes.

commit with a message of merge.

Finally the project is ready.

Thankyou.
